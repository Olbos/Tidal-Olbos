Olbos Live Coding Environment




My custom Tidalcycles bootup.

The .scd file contains my bootup file with synthesizers and effects developed to work with SuperDirt. For some of them you will need the SC3 Plugins.

The .tidal file is a mapping of all the parameters necessary to run synths and effects.

Further informations can be found in the files' comments.
