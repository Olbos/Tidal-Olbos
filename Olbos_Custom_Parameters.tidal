    waveblender = pF "waveblender" -- the name of a custom wavetable synthesizer
    wb = "waveblender" --shortcut for the waveblender SynthDef
    xenbass = pF "xenbass" -- a stochastic synth bass
    xenharp = pF "xenharp" -- a stochastic harp sound suitable for melodic fragments
    tubes = pF "tubes" -- a physical model of two resonating tubes, written with Nesso
    depth = pF "depth" --generally used as a detuned chorus effect on SynthDefs (in the tubes synth the range is 0-1, in all others synths it's the frequency amount of displacement)
    pos = pF "pos" --the position of the bufreader in the Waveblender SynthDef, from 0 to 1
    f1 = pF "f1" -- freq control of tube1 of tubes synth (range 3,1000)

    diffract = pF "diffract" --an FFT stretch/shift effect, this param is for stretch
    diffshift = pF "diffshift" -- shift parameter for diffract FFT effect
    diffmix = pF "diffmix" -- dry/wet control diffract FFT effect (0 to 1)
    invert = pF "invert" --fft spectral inversion (from 0 to 1, be careful with high values and use lpf to avoid strong hi freq sounds)
    tanh = pF "tanh" --tanh limiter/distortion (from 1 to n, high number will increase loudness A LOT)
    tantanh = pF "tantanh" --tantanh limiter/distortion (same param as tanh with a different flavour)
    ringshape = pF "ringshape" -- ringmod/waveshaping, the parameter controls frequency
    scr = pF "scr" -- wipe factor of bin scramble effect by Nesso, from 0 to 1
    smooth = pF "smooth" -- sets power of 2 value of fft bins for bin scrambling
    scry = pF "scry" -- amount of random displacement of bin scramble, from 0 to 1
