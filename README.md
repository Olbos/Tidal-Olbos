Olbos Live Coding Environment




My custom Tidalcycles bootup.

The .scd file contains my bootup file with synthesizers and effects developed to work with SuperDirt. For some of them you will need the SC3 Plugins.

The Parameters file is a mapping of all the parameters necessary to run synths and effects.

The Functions contains useful shortcuts and custom functions you can use even without my synths. There is a list of functions made in order to implement sieves ad theorized by Xenakis in his book "Formalized Music". 

Further informations can be found in the files' comments.
